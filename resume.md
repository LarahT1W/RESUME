+ **Summary**

I am a graduate student of food science who find his true passion in data science. As a member of my mentor's  research team, I have  handled tons of data. I found it very tedious to analysis data with SPSS, so I want to find a better way to do this. After I understand what python and R can do with data, I said this is what I am going to do.

I start teaching myself programming and data manipulating.
Now, I finally graduated from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
I can expertly  clean manipulate  data  with python, R and SQL, find
Pattern in data with machine learning, and visualizing data with d3.js.


+ **Technical Skills：**

 - Languages: python,R,Javascript,HTML5,CSS3,
 - Frameworks/Libraries: NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,scikit-learn,d3.js,dimple.js, ggplot2
 - Other: git/github,SQL,MongoDB

### Projects
https://github.com/ShawnXiha/Udacity_Data_Analiyst_Nanodegree

1.	**Investigate a Dataset**
 - Investigate, analysis and find problems in a dataset using NumPy and Pandas
 - Plot data with Matplotlib and find relationship between features
 - Analysis significance scipy

2.	**Explore and Summarize Data**
 - Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore  data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

3.	**Identify Fraud from Enron Email**
 - Analyze, clean and get data ready for machine learning, combine features with PCA (principal component analysis)
 - Tone machine learning algorithm to get best performance. My final classifier have scores: Precision: 0.38639 Recall: 0.59600

4.	**Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data**
 - Parse map data of Shanghai from OpenStreetMap, find problems in map data
 - Fix Chinese mixed English and Pinying street name, and shape data into MongoDB
 - Analysis data with MongoDB

5.	**Make Effective Data Visualization**
 - Data visualization with d3.js and dimple.js
 - Get feedback, improve visualization according to feedback

6.	**A/B testing**
 - Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
 - Design a A/B test on reducing the number of student cancel after free trial
